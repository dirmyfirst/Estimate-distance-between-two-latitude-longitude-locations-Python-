# Estimate distance between two latitude/longitude locations (Python)

This is the subsequent project after getting the coordinates from Google Map - Geocoding API. Calculate the distance between two locations, in this case, condos to metro stations.

The result is the list of closest metro stations and distance to each property. Please note that the term 'distance' in this project is actually 'displacement', only measuring from its starting position to the final position regardless the actual walkable path.
